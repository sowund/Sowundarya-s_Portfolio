Portfolio:

A high-performance personal portfolio designed to showcase my technical projects and academic journey. Built with a focus on User Experience (UX), Type Safety, and Fluid Motion.

🚀 Live Site: [https://sowundaryas-portfolio.netlify.app/]

🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture
I chose this specific stack to ensure the site is fast, scalable, and easy to maintain:

React 18 (Vite): Utilized for fast refresh during development and optimized production builds.

TypeScript: Implemented to catch errors early through static typing and ensure data integrity.

Tailwind CSS: Used for a utility-first styling approach, ensuring a responsive design without bulky CSS files.

Framer Motion: Powering the "Get in Touch" and "Hero" sections with spring-based physics animations.

Lucide React: Providing a consistent and accessible icon system.


Key Coursework: Data Structures, Database Management, Web Technology, Software Engineering.

🏗 Key Components & Logic
Contact System
Instead of a simple mailto link, I built a custom Contact Form component that:

Handles local state management via React Hooks (useState).

Provides real-time UI feedback (Loading states, Success alerts).

Integrates with a secure backend API (Web3Forms) to deliver inquiries directly to my professional email.

Animation Strategy
Used useInView from Framer Motion to ensure animations only trigger when the user scrolls to that specific section, improving the initial load performance and user engagement.
